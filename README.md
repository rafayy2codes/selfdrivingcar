Overview
This project demonstrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent controlling a Formula 1 style car navigating an oval track with realistic features such as fuel consumption and mandatory pit stops. The agent learns using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with curriculum learning, progressively tackling harder tracks.

The environment is built using Pygame for 2D rendering and physics simulation, while the RL agent is implemented with PyTorch. The project integrates perception (sensors), car dynamics, fuel management, and strategy (pit stops) to provide a rich RL challenge.
